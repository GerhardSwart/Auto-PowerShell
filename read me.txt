Two project to look at.
1)DailyMerge
  This is a script that does code merge, create pullrequest directly in Azure Devops.
  It starts with the DailyMerge.bat.
  It is not intended to run on schedule cause user intervention is needed to validate the pullrequest and fix merge issues if needed.

2) ApiTester
  This a PowerShell Class to test HTTP API endpoints. Still under construction.
